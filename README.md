# Iris Data Analysis Project

## Project Description
This project involves loading, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the Iris dataset using Python. It demonstrates basic data science tasks including data exploration, grouping, and various plots.

## Objectives
- Load and explore the Iris dataset.
- Clean missing data.
- Perform basic statistical analysis and grouping.
- Create visualizations to identify data patterns.
- Present insights derived from the data.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## How to Run/View the Project
1. Clone this repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-data-analysis.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install required packages if needed:  
   `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`
4. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script in your preferred environment.

## Insights and Reflections
- The Iris dataset shows clear separation between species based on petal and sepal dimensions.
- Missing data can be easily handled by filling with mean values in this context.
- Visualizations confirm expected biological differences across species.
